     *    the bus scan function.
     * 2. If we wrote the configuration register (which we'd have to do every
     *    time because we keep powering it off), we could lower the precision
     *    to 9 bits (0.5Â°C resolution) and cut the conversion time from 750ms
     *    to 94. So, even with the config write time, it should save power.
     *
     * Correcting the above will likely mean making an 18B20 specific library
     * of my own which uses the esp-idf-onewire library for comms.
