     * 2. If we wrote the configuration register (which we'd have to do every
     *    time because we keep powering it off), we could lower the precision
     *    to 9 bits (0.5Â°C resolution) and cut the conversion time from 750ms
     *    to 94. So, even with the config write time, it should save power.
     *     ^^^ - LIES!!!! There is an EEPROM. We can check it on boot and, if
     *           it's wrong, reconfigure it and save it. Done.
     * 
     *           Of course, none of this functionality is actually written
     *           yet, so I'll need to add it.
     *
     * Correcting the above will likely mean making an 18B20 specific library
     * of my own which uses the esp-idf-onewire library for comms.
     *     ^^^ - More LIES!!!! I'm just hacking up the ds18x20 driver to add
     *           what I want.
